# react-batch-tracker
React Context based npm package for batching calls to a function, somewhat like lodash debounce, but more eccentric. Supports creating several trackers that can track state change by following individual data objects. Goal is to facilitate autosave and undo functionality, and for optimising client -> API requests.
